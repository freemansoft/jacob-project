To build and run:

Unpack the source archive or check the files out of CVS into d:\jacob 

Install the following tools
	Microsoft Visual Studio, a stripped down version is available from the MS web site.
	Eclipse from www.eclipse.org.
	Java jdk 1.4 (this was built using 1.4.2.09)
	
The following configuration was used by most of the development team:
	JDK = d:\j2sdk1.4.2_09
	DEST_DIR = d:\jacob
	MSDEVDIR = d:\apps\\"Microsoft Visual Studio"\VC98

This project has been converted completely over to ANT.  You can
run ANT from inside of eclipse or from the command line.
The ant process is driven off of a configuration file
compilation_tools.properties.  Instructions on the information required
in that file are contained in build.xml in the root directory.

Ant, via build.xml will do the following with teh default target.
	Build the Java code
	Build the jni code
	create the dll
	create jar file

The package target creates the 
	javadoc and 
	zip files

ECLIPSE

Eclipse users will have to do some minor tweaks to their project if they 
want to use the integrated build process.  This is because the unit
tests are files located in the "unittest" directory while
the project source files themselves are in "src" the root directory.
	Eclipse automatically adds the whole project as a source directory
	Remove the root of the project from the build path
	Add folders samples, src and unittest to the build path
	Exclude *.txt from each of the newly added folders.  
	
The Servlet examples that required j2ee libraries to compile have temporarily
been removed.

The java code is in .\src.
The C++ code is in .\jni.
