<h3>Known Issues</h3>
<UL>
<LI>The wrapper classes will require a little hand tweaking
	in most situations to get them to compile.
<LI>Some methods will be generated more than once if they are
	detected in a "class" more than once. 
<LI>This will generate the wrappers for most of a DLL but 
	will sometimes run into problems with unrecognized types.
	A good example is MSWord.  It will generate a lot of classes
	but will have problems with some so the wrappers will have
	to be hand tweaked in roder to work.
<LI>EVENTS and STRUCTURES. Not supported
<LI>VT_PTR type is not well supported
</UL>
